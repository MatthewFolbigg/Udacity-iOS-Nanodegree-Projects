# On The Map
On the map is a project completed as part of the Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree to practice getting data from and posting data to an API using an NSURlSession.

#### User Locations
* Uses the Parse API to get a list of User Location objects
* These location objects are displayed both in a UITabelView and on a MKMapView. The user selects the display method via a tab bar contorller

#### Sign In
* The user can authenticate themselves using Udacity login credentials via the Udacity student API
* Once logged in the user is able to post locations to the Parse API

#### Add Location
* Users can post locations with an attached URL of their choice. These locations and URLs are visible to other users of the App.

#### Open URLs
* Links attahced to the user location objects can be opened in safari by tapping on them in a lacation detail view
* The user can also open the udacity sign up page directly from the login screen if they dont yet have an account
